## Coding Schedule

**3/14** Proof of Concept (POC) Python framework, and found some projects on the Internet and GitHub. Developed a sign-up API, wrote tests to cover it, and added error handling.

_Problem:_ Considering whether to use an ORM or directly use SQL syntax and a validation tool.

**3/15** Developed the sign-up API and wrote the API documentation. Researched YAML for Swagger.

**3/16-3/17** Encountered an issue with building the Python image. Used venv to create a virtual environment to solve this problem, and successfully resolved it.

[Issue: Cannot build Python image â€“ failure at pip install requirements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70942357/cannot-build-python-image-failure-at-pip-install-requirements)

**3/18** Updated the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml and wrote the coding schedule.
